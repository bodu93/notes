#### Reentrancy

> In computing, a computer program or subroutine is called reetrant if it can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely be called again ("re-entered") before its previous invocations complete execution. 



#### Thread safety

> Thread safety is a computer programming concept applicable to multi-threaded code. Thread-safe code only manipulates shared data structures in a manner that  ensure that all threads behave properly and fulfil their design specifications without unintended interaction.



**This definition of reentrancy differs from that of thread-safety in multi-threaded environments. A reentrant subroutine can achieve thread-safety, but being reentrant alone might not be sufficient to be thread-safe in all situations. Conversely, thread-safe code does not necessarily have to be reentrant.**
